\begin{abstract}
This article is presented to propose an improvement for an existing problem regarding the performance of LLVM JIT (Just in Time) compiler, which is an inherent slowness during the start-up of virtual machines (VM), Ex: VMKit ~\cite{arch1}. Our proposed solution is to use a Trace based JIT compiler as an adaptive optimization for the current LLVM JIT.  Moreover our implementation will have a mixed mode execution including a byte-code interpreter and LLVM JIT together. In the end, we will benchmark our implementation so that we can compare the difference in performance of the current LLVM JIT and the improved LLVM JIT with VMKit framework.\\
 \textbf{\textit{Key words}}:  VMKit, LLVM, JIT, VM
