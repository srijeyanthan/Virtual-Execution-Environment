VMKit provides a substrate for the development of VMs within a short period of time but still it has left interesting research areas in optimizing the execution of the VMs. Therefore our proposed solution for the LLVM JIT improvement would be an exciting research area to identify and exercise Virtualization concepts in practice.
Because the amount of documentation on this VMKit, LLVM is so scarce, most of the considerations we presented come from code analysis. Overall, the code we produced does not have many lines,nor did it take much time to write, instead most of the time
on this project was spent on reading through the source code of the VMKit architecture and LLVM IR generation and trying to find out how to best handle
the data structures or which was the best location for the developed functions.  We have contacted thorough llvm IRC channel for further clarification and gained more information about LLVM functionalities.
